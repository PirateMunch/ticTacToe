# ticTacToe
The Odin Project - Tic Tac Toe v2.

I decided to completely restart this project to take more time to learn 
the lessons Odin really wanted me to grasp, storing logic in private
modules/factorys, scope, closure.
My first attempt I finished the brief (minus AI bonus content), however
I did not use correctly the 3 main objects. I spaghetti coded into 1.
--I enjoyed the first project and want to keep it. hence v2.

I might learn tailwind for this run thru.
